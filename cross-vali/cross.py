# predict 
y = data['Price'] # we can predict anythin else too like landsize , rooms et citra but price make sense 
# importin ml libraries 
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor # the model we use 
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer # remember the imputation huh handing missing values ?? rem 
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline # pipeline makes our life easy üôÇ
# now lez create a pipeline

# so wha i just do dw i just crearte a pipeline and a preprocesser so it preprocess the missing values by imputation and 
# add a model as RandomForest to it use this to predict the prices see how easy it is and i didnt do traning and testin why ? just wai 

# now i use cross-validation which i learned today ig better then mae (they say tho )
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
import numpy as n
# multipley by -1 so get - mae

# lezz see the result noe 
print('MAE Scores:', scores)
# basically cross val is the mean so we get this 
print('Cross-val:', n.mean(scores))
# i hope it work üòê
#just almost 30 lines to use a model to predict prices arent tha amazing ?? or predict anython u just have to change y tho and little bit x
